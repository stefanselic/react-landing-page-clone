# Implement landing page with React, CSS Modules and SCSS.

Rebuild it in React (looking at the code as little as possible).

## TODO

- [x] Choose a landing page from [Landingfolio](https://www.landingfolio.com/)
- [ ] Copy all elements of the landing page
- [ ] Style the elements

## Stretch TODOs

- [ ] Copy animations and videos
- [ ] Copy interactive parts of the website
- [ ] Right after [creating your first (empty) Git commit](https://learn.upleveled.io/courses/bootcamp-pern/modules/cheatsheet-command-line/#4-create-and-push-an-initial-commit), create a new branch. Use this branch to [open a pull request on GitHub](https://learn.upleveled.io/courses/bootcamp-pern/modules/cheatsheet-git-github/#opening-pull-requests)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Preflight runs through without errors in your project
  - [ ] Link in your GitHub repo's About section: Netlify deployed website
- [ ] Link to original landing page in comment below
- [ ] Project has been [imported into CodeSandbox](https://learn.upleveled.io/courses/bootcamp-pern/modules/cheatsheet-tasks/#codesandbox) and a comment has been added below with the sandbox URL
- [ ] [Drone bot](https://learn.upleveled.io/courses/bootcamp-pern/modules/cheatsheet-tasks/#upleveled-drone) has been tagged and responded with a passing message
- [ ] Correct GitHub commit message format (see [Writing Commit Messages](https://learn.upleveled.io/courses/bootcamp-pern/modules/cheatsheet-git-github/#writing-commit-messages))

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
