Rebuild it in React (looking at the code as little as possible).

- [ ] Copy all elements of the landing page
- [ ] Style the elements

- [ ] Right after [creating your first (empty) Git commit](https://learn.upleveled.io/courses/bootcamp-pern/modules/cheatsheet-command-line/#4-create-and-push-an-initial-commit), create a new branch.
